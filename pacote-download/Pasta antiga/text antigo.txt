AULA 1
Why statistics?
*summarize numerical information efficient
*inferential statistics ? too many people ?
*data is impoortant to validate and evidence conclusion
*3 steps:
1- data organization
2- summarization and categorization
3- data analisys (DONT SIMPLY SHOW DATA, TELL THE RESEARCH STORY WITH YOUR DATA)
*constant (pi number) x variables (heigth)
*datatypes 
categorical{qualitative} [(ordinal there is a order like 5 stars,4 stars), (nominal is like labels, apple banana), (binary is 2 possibilities, man x woman)] pie chart // pareto chart // bar chart
numerical{quantitative} [(discrete is count number of fruits) and (continuous is measured size of population)] - Boxplot // Histogram
IT IS NECESSARY TO EXPLAIN EACH OF THAT IN THE PROJECT
*Measures of centre Mean - average, or the sum of numbers divided by the number of numbers / mode (most common value ) / median (middle number when the number are arranged se for numero par eh a media os dois valores do meio)
VALE A PENA CITAR TODOS ESSES VALORES NO PROJETO MESMO SEM PRECISAR 
*frequency table / group frequency table
*outlier afeta mais a media do que median e mode
*quartiles (q1 25% of the values are less than or equal to)(q2 sample median 50% of the values are less than or equal to) (q3 75%) 
Interquartile range it measures the spread (just like sd and range// TALVEZ DE PRA MENCIONAR NO TRABALHO) : IQR Q3-Q1 I
*Measures od dispersion: Range (difference between largest and smallest); SD (average difference or typical error); CV (percentage of the mean); ADICIONAR VARIANCE NO TRABALHO
*Bell curves represents normal distribution SERIA BOM INCLUIR NO TRABALHO
*Skewed data (quando bell curve nao aparece perfeito)/ positive and negative skew NO PROJETO EXPLICAR PQ ESTA POSITIVE OU NEGATIVE SKEW
*CV EH BOM PRA COMPARAR WHOLE MILK X SKIN, JA O SD EH BOM NUMA COMPARACAO GLOBAL
*USAR EXAMPLE DESCRIPTION PARA EXPLICAR SEUS DADOS
*boxplot IQR + Q1 + Q2 + Q3 + maximum + minimum + outlier + upper/lower whisker / NAO ESQUECER DE TER LABELS, pelo menos n=20
*COPIAR BOXPLOT COMPONENTS EXPLAINED NO TRABALHO
*COLOCAR SCATERPLOT 
*visualizing 2 variables:
Y numerical x numerical : SCATERPLOT (mostrar ano por valor)
Y numerical x categorical : BOXPLOT (mostrar calor por categoria)
Y categorical x numerical: BOXPLOT WITH GROUPS (TRANSPOSED)
Y categorical x categorical: STACKED BAR CHART OR CROSS TABULATION

AULA 2
CORRELATION AND REGRESSION 
Both are basd on multivariate distribution (distribution of multiple variables)
Correlation - association or absence of the relationship between 2 variables
correlation coeficient (r) vai de -1 a +1
when one variable incrases as the other increases - correlation positive
when one decreases as the other increases - correlation negative
absecence of correlation = 0
 Scaterplot pode ser usado pra mostrar Correlation
 coeficient of correlation (r ao quadrado) is the proportion of the variation in Y whick is explained by the variation in X, valor dado em percentual (Y = a + bX)
 1 - (r ao quadrado) mostrara uma porcentagem de variacao que nao eh explicada

Regression - predicts the value of dependent variable based on the know of the independent variable
RESPONSE AND PREDICTOR
what is the response for example is the exam score
what is the predictor for example is the revision time
in that case as much as you have revision time, higher will be your exam score
the idea to define it is what question you want to answer, for example:
quanto mais passa o tempo, mais bebemos leite, nesse caso seria 
in that case as much as you pass years, higher will be your milk ingestion
so response would be value of milk
predictor would be years

Fit regression model results
regression equation:
(Y = a + bX)
exam score = 42.78 + 0.57 revision time
isso significa que, se uma pessoa estudar zero horas ela tiraria 42.78
se ela estudar 1 unidade de revision time ela tiraria 42.78 + 0.57
se ela estudar 4 unidade de revision time ela tiraria 42.78 + 0.57 x 4

No nosso exemplo do whole milk
VALUE = 11341 - 5.465 years
Ssupondo o ano de 2000
Value = 11341 - 5.465 x 2000 
value =410 o que eh proximo do valor real 423
for every one unit increase in year, the predicted value decreases by 5.465 units. The constant term (11341) represents the predicted value when the year is zero (unrealistic in real life scenario, but logically in math terms based in our data, if data was bigger, we could have a more reliable result, as our data is small, that brings more possibilities of error)

P-value goes from 0 to 1: a small p-value (<0.05) suggests that the coeficient is statistically significant
in our scenario the P-value for Year is 0.000, so we can concludes that years has a statistically positive effect on value (nao sei se fala positivo por ser + no sinal ou se eh pq eh proximo a 0)

R-sq (r ao quadrado) represents the proportion of the variance in the vVALUE that is explained by the regression model
in our scenario R-sq is 81.54%, which means that the model explains 81.54% of the variability in exam scores

R-sq(adj) (r ao quadrado adjusted) is a more acurate measure of the model's fit when there are multiple terms in the model. it penalizes the model for having more terms
the adjuste R-sq in our scenario is 80.93% ( in our scenario as we are using only one predictor (Year), that doesnt change much, would change if we include more predictors) por isso os valores sao parecidos do adjuste e do nao

R-sq(pred) is an estimate of how well the model would fit a new data set, in our case it is 79.15%

graficos (nao precisa usar todos, usa os que forem importantes)
-Normal Probability plot this plot compares the residual to a normal distribution, if the residuals are normaly distributed the points will fall close to the line.
In our scenario residuals may not be perfectly normal, but they are not severely deviating from normally either

- Histogram shows distribution of residuals the shape of histogram also used to assess normality (expected the bell shape)
in our case the histogram appears roughly symmetrical skewed to the rigth (positive) which is consistent with normality

- Versus fit:shows the residuals plotter against the fitted values
if there is no pattern, it suggests the residuals are random scattered and no relationship between residuals and fitted value
when there is no pattern is a good sign
in our case we have a pattern (o que significa?)

- Versus order: displays the residuals on the y axis and the order in which data were collected on the x-axis
purpose is to identify any patterns in the residual that might indicate a violation of the assumption independence of errors
in our case (o que significa?)

multiple regression (no caso do projeto nao sera necessario, pois nao temos + de 2 variaveis)


AULA 3
The purpose of an experiment is to discover information - This information may provide insight leading to action that will improve a process
A large number of variables can potentially effect the performance of the system. Controllable and uncontrollable (noise factors)
Objective of an experiment: which variables are most influential, small noise
Design of experiment (DOE) and statistical process control (SPC) are very closed interrelated

DOE is an active statistical method, SPC is a passive statistical method

SPC: watch the process and wait for info to lead to change

DOE: perform tests on the process, making changes in the inputs and observing changes in the output.

PODE USAR ESSES TERMOS NO TRABALHO
Independent variables are variables that are manipulated or are changed by researchers and whose effects are measured and compared (can also be called factor)
The dependent variables refer to that type of variable that measures the affect of the independent variable(s) on the test units.  (response variable)

If we wants to estimate milk consumption, then the factors such as type of milk and year are independent variables, while the  milk consumption is highly dependent on such factors. Therefore, they are designated as the  dependent variable or respnse variable.

Factors are the variables that experimenters control during an experiment in order to determine their effect on the response variable, only use a limited number of values

It is important to see factors when they are numerical should be a limited number of numerical values, in our scenario we migth use different ranges to observe it better, instead of taking all years, one by one, lets assume decades, for example, more numbers lead ro more errors

DOE CONCEPTS
1- formulate your question properly, what you want to achieve in your project?
* how is the consumption over the decades of milk / whole / skimmed
*does the consumption of milk of aspecific type yes affected by the decades

2- you want to compare it with some scenario, some real life example, for example eyou could compare it with the increase of vegan people in the decades, (precisaria achar algum dado para ver isso)ou vai tentar comparar apenas leite contra leite?
VOCE TAMBEM PODE CRIAR SEUS PROPRIOS DADOS SOBRE VEGANOS POR EXEMPLO E EXPLICAR PARA ELA, ITS FINE TO DO IF YOU MENTION IT, AS THAT IS THE LIMITATION OF YOUR DATA AND I NEEDED TO MAKE UP THE DATA

3 - you should be able to replicate your experiment to avoid erros BIAS , nessa parte explicaria porque usou a decada como um todo ao inves de usar apenas um ano escolhido de forma randomica, that reduces the effect of uncontrolled variation, in other words increase the precision, avoid problems with outliers
error variance
learning effect (da pra tentar dizer algo do tipo, a pessoa depois que aprende a consumir o leite skimmed, e sabendo como utiliza-lo melhor no dia dia diminui o learning effect, pois ela aprende que pra receita dela do dia dia e pro consumo dela ser tao prazeroso quanto o normal ela precisa fazer pequenos ajustes ate chegar na expectativa dela)


4 -randomization, eh mais focado em experimentos quando a pessoa nao sabe se vai tomar remedio ou placebo, sao escolhidas de forma randomica, muito dificil pensar em algo nesse estilo no nosso trabalho,a nao ser que crie uma pesquisa falsa fazendo diferentes pessoas testarem o leite de forma randomica e dizer qual dos dois a pessoa prefere, ai nesse caso daria pra aplicar o conceito de randomizacao, caso nao queira fazer isso, eh importante explicar que nao ha randomizacao no seu caso, pois sao dados coletados especificos 

5 -Stratification (blocking)  A block is a subset of the experimental units, which are believed to be similar in responsiveness, but which may differ in responsiveness from the units in another block, unica possibilidade de usar seria dizer que o blocking eh na pesquisa que voce conduziu com as pessoas testando sabor de leite, nao daria pra fazer toda a pesquisa em apenas um dia e entao voce teve que fazer em dias diferentes, blocking eh entendido como fazer em blocos, ou seja palavra dividir eh importante para facilitar o entendimento
CUIDADO PARA NAO CONFUNDIR COM RANDOM

6- factorial experiments

UMA BOA TABELA NAO MOSTRA MUITAS CASAS DECIMAIS:
EH MELHOR MEAN = 11.2 DO QUE MEAN= 11.2965

Hypothesis testing is a statistical analysis that uses sample data to assess two mutually exclusive theories about the properties of a population.
Statisticians call these theories the null hypothesis and the alternative hypothesis.
When you can reject the null hypothesis, the results are statistically significant (p value < 0.05), and your data support the theory that an effect exists at the population level.
In testing, you use significance levels and p-values to determine whether the test results are statistically significant.

Hypothesis testing is a form of inferential statistics that allows us to draw conclusions about an entire population based on a representative sample. We need to use a hypothesis test to determine the likelihood of obtaining our sample mean if the population mean is 260.
Descriptive Statistics Alone Won’t Answer the Question

Sampling distributions allow you to determine the likelihood of obtaining your sample statistic

We’ll graph the sampling distribution based on the assumption that the meanfuelcost for the entire population has not changed and is still 260 (null hypothesis)

We use the null hypothesis value as the basis of comparison for our observed sample value.

The hypothesis testing procedure quantifies the unusualness of our sample with a probability and then compares it to an evidentiary standard.
Significance levels and p-values allow us to test these two hypotheses:

Null hypothesis: The population mean equals the null hypothesis mean (260).

Alternative hypothesis: The population mean does not equal the null hypothesis mean (260).

por exemplo podemos pegar um ano especifico (2000) usar ele como null hypothesis e outro ano (2023) como nossa alternativa hypothesis

We’ll graph the sampling distribution based on the assumption that the milk consumption for the entire population has not changed and is still same value as in 2000 (null hypothesis)
We use the null hypothesis value as the basis of comparison for our observed sample value.
Alternative hypothesis: The consumption is not equal the null hypothesis mean .

Type I error: The rejects a null hypothesis that is true. You can think of this as a false positive.
Type II error: The test fails to reject a null hypothesis that is false. You can think of this as a false negative.

we can estimate the sample distribution using t distribution

Significance Level (Alpha)
It specifies how strongly the sample evidence must contradict the null hypothesis before you can reject the null for the entire population.

Lower significance levels also reduce the power of a hypothesis test to detect a difference that does exist.

a significance level of 0.05 signifies a 5% risk of deciding that an effect exists when it does not exist.

Use p-values and significance levels together to help you determine which hypothesis the data support.

the Significance Level defines how far the sample value must be from the know value before we can reject the null hypothesis

P-values 
It specifies how strongly the sample evidence must contradict the null hypothesis before you can reject the null for the entire population.
For instance, a significance level of 0.05 signifies a 5% risk of deciding that an effect exists when it does not exist.

The effect is the distance between the sample value and null value:
330.6 –260 = 70.6
Region: 260 +/-70.6
The total probability of the two shaded regions is 0.03112 
cada lado do grafico fica com metade entao 0.01556

If your P value is less than or equal to your alpha level, reject the null hypothesis.

one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) is used to determine whether there are any statistically significant differences between the means of three or more independent (unrelated) groups.
ANOVA determines whether three or more populations are statistically different from each other
the samples are independent of each other

have (approximately) normal distributions or when the sample number is high (e.g., > 30 per group).

More samples are better, but the tests can be performed with as little as 3 samples per condition.
A company tests a new marketing campaign in three different regions (East, West, and South). They measure the average monthly sales in each region for the past year. One-way ANOVA would assess if there's a significant difference in average sales between the three regions.
