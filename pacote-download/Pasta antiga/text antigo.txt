AULA 1
Why statistics?
*summarize numerical information efficient
*inferential statistics ? too many people ?
*data is impoortant to validate and evidence conclusion
*3 steps:
1- data organization
2- summarization and categorization
3- data analisys (DONT SIMPLY SHOW DATA, TELL THE RESEARCH STORY WITH YOUR DATA)
*constant (pi number) x variables (heigth)
*datatypes 
categorical{qualitative} [(ordinal there is a order like 5 stars,4 stars), (nominal is like labels, apple banana), (binary is 2 possibilities, man x woman)] pie chart // pareto chart // bar chart
numerical{quantitative} [(discrete is count number of fruits) and (continuous is measured size of population)] - Boxplot // Histogram
IT IS NECESSARY TO EXPLAIN EACH OF THAT IN THE PROJECT
*Measures of centre Mean - average, or the sum of numbers divided by the number of numbers / mode (most common value ) / median (middle number when the number are arranged se for numero par eh a media os dois valores do meio)
VALE A PENA CITAR TODOS ESSES VALORES NO PROJETO MESMO SEM PRECISAR 
*frequency table / group frequency table
*outlier afeta mais a media do que median e mode
*quartiles (q1 25% of the values are less than or equal to)(q2 sample median 50% of the values are less than or equal to) (q3 75%) 
Interquartile range it measures the spread (just like sd and range// TALVEZ DE PRA MENCIONAR NO TRABALHO) : IQR Q3-Q1 I
*Measures od dispersion: Range (difference between largest and smallest); SD (average difference or typical error); CV (percentage of the mean); ADICIONAR VARIANCE NO TRABALHO
*Bell curves represents normal distribution SERIA BOM INCLUIR NO TRABALHO
*Skewed data (quando bell curve nao aparece perfeito)/ positive and negative skew NO PROJETO EXPLICAR PQ ESTA POSITIVE OU NEGATIVE SKEW
*CV EH BOM PRA COMPARAR WHOLE MILK X SKIN, JA O SD EH BOM NUMA COMPARACAO GLOBAL
*USAR EXAMPLE DESCRIPTION PARA EXPLICAR SEUS DADOS
*boxplot IQR + Q1 + Q2 + Q3 + maximum + minimum + outlier + upper/lower whisker / NAO ESQUECER DE TER LABELS, pelo menos n=20
*COPIAR BOXPLOT COMPONENTS EXPLAINED NO TRABALHO
*COLOCAR SCATERPLOT 
*visualizing 2 variables:
Y numerical x numerical : SCATERPLOT (mostrar ano por valor)
Y numerical x categorical : BOXPLOT (mostrar calor por categoria)
Y categorical x numerical: BOXPLOT WITH GROUPS (TRANSPOSED)
Y categorical x categorical: STACKED BAR CHART OR CROSS TABULATION

AULA 2
CORRELATION AND REGRESSION 
Both are basd on multivariate distribution (distribution of multiple variables)
Correlation - association or absence of the relationship between 2 variables
correlation coeficient (r) vai de -1 a +1
when one variable incrases as the other increases - correlation positive
when one decreases as the other increases - correlation negative
absecence of correlation = 0
 Scaterplot pode ser usado pra mostrar Correlation
 coeficient of correlation (r ao quadrado) is the proportion of the variation in Y whick is explained by the variation in X, valor dado em percentual (Y = a + bX)
 1 - (r ao quadrado) mostrara uma porcentagem de variacao que nao eh explicada

Regression - predicts the value of dependent variable based on the know of the independent variable
RESPONSE AND PREDICTOR
what is the response for example is the exam score
what is the predictor for example is the revision time
in that case as much as you have revision time, higher will be your exam score
the idea to define it is what question you want to answer, for example:
quanto mais passa o tempo, mais bebemos leite, nesse caso seria 
in that case as much as you pass years, higher will be your milk ingestion
so response would be value of milk
predictor would be years

Fit regression model results
regression equation:
(Y = a + bX)
exam score = 42.78 + 0.57 revision time
isso significa que, se uma pessoa estudar zero horas ela tiraria 42.78
se ela estudar 1 unidade de revision time ela tiraria 42.78 + 0.57
se ela estudar 4 unidade de revision time ela tiraria 42.78 + 0.57 x 4

No nosso exemplo do whole milk
VALUE = 11341 - 5.465 years
Ssupondo o ano de 2000
Value = 11341 - 5.465 x 2000 
value =410 o que eh proximo do valor real 423
for every one unit increase in year, the predicted value decreases by 5.465 units. The constant term (11341) represents the predicted value when the year is zero (unrealistic in real life scenario, but logically in math terms based in our data, if data was bigger, we could have a more reliable result, as our data is small, that brings more possibilities of error)

P-value goes from 0 to 1: a small p-value (<0.05) suggests that the coeficient is statistically significant
in our scenario the P-value for Year is 0.000, so we can concludes that years has a statistically positive effect on value (nao sei se fala positivo por ser + no sinal ou se eh pq eh proximo a 0)

R-sq (r ao quadrado) represents the proportion of the variance in the vVALUE that is explained by the regression model
in our scenario R-sq is 81.54%, which means that the model explains 81.54% of the variability in exam scores

R-sq(adj) (r ao quadrado adjusted) is a more acurate measure of the model's fit when there are multiple terms in the model. it penalizes the model for having more terms
the adjuste R-sq in our scenario is 80.93% ( in our scenario as we are using only one predictor (Year), that doesnt change much, would change if we include more predictors) por isso os valores sao parecidos do adjuste e do nao

R-sq(pred) is an estimate of how well the model would fit a new data set, in our case it is 79.15%

graficos (nao precisa usar todos, usa os que forem importantes)
-Normal Probability plot this plot compares the residual to a normal distribution, if the residuals are normaly distributed the points will fall close to the line.
In our scenario residuals may not be perfectly normal, but they are not severely deviating from normally either

- Histogram shows distribution of residuals the shape of histogram also used to assess normality (expected the bell shape)
in our case the histogram appears roughly symmetrical skewed to the rigth (positive) which is consistent with normality

- Versus fit:shows the residuals plotter against the fitted values
if there is no pattern, it suggests the residuals are random scattered and no relationship between residuals and fitted value
when there is no pattern is a good sign
in our case we have a pattern (o que significa?)

- Versus order: displays the residuals on the y axis and the order in which data were collected on the x-axis
purpose is to identify any patterns in the residual that might indicate a violation of the assumption independence of errors
in our case (o que significa?)

multiple regression (no caso do projeto nao sera necessario, pois nao temos + de 2 variaveis)
